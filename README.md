## Brief Overview

This internship was realized in team comBi of the LS2N (Laboratoire des sciences du num√©rique de Nantes) at Nantes University in L3.

The aim of this internship is to try to refutate conjectures concerning graphs by using a RL algorithm called "deep-cross entropy".
Our work has for ambition to question the production, sometimes excessive, of new conjectures and to provide an efficient tool to separate the true conjectures from the false ones.
